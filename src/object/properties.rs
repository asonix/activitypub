//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate activitypub;
//! extern crate serde;
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate serde_derive;
//!
//! use activitypub::{Object, object::properties::ApObjectProperties};
//!

//! #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
//! pub struct MyObject {
//!     #[serde(rename = "type")]
//!     pub kind: String,
//!
//!     /// Define a require property for the MyObject type
//!     pub my_property: String,
//!
//!     #[serde(flatten)]
//!     pub object_props: ApObjectProperties,
//! }
//!
//! impl Object for MyObject {}
