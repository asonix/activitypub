//! To use these properties in your own types, you can flatten them into your struct with serde:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate activitypub;
//! extern crate serde;
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate serde_derive;
//!
//! use activitypub::{Object, Actor, actor::properties::ApActorProperties};
//!

//! #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
//! pub struct MyActor {
//!     #[serde(rename = "type")]
//!     pub kind: String,
//!
//!     /// Define a require property for the MyActor type
//!     pub my_property: String,
//!
//!     #[serde(flatten)]
//!     pub actor_props: ApActorProperties,
//! }
//!
//! impl Object for MyActor {}
//! impl Actor for MyActor {}
//! #
//! # fn main() {}
